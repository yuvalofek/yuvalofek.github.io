            <p>I'm a problem solver at heart, always on the lookout for interesting challenges and elegant solutions. As an engineer turned data scientist, I'm passionate about using data-driven approaches to tackle complex problems and drive meaningful impact.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm a Sr. Data Scientist II at <b>KKR</b>, where I develop advanced AI models and platforms to drive innovation and enhance operational efficiency. My focus is on full-stack development of AI-driven tools and process automation to improve investment decisions across KKR's $70B+ deployed capital. Previously, I was a Data Science Associate at <b>Morgan Stanley</b>, where I worked on advanced data pipelines, improved model accuracy, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies.</p>
            <p>I hold a master's degree in electrical engineering with a concentration in machine learning from <a href="https://cooper.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cooper Union</a>, where my thesis involved augmenting satellite imagery through deep-learning-based synthesis for improved flood response planning.</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about continuous learning, exploring new methodologies, and collaborating on projects like <a href="https://tinydance.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DanceMuse</a>, which brings dance-generating AI models to the hands of dancers and choreographers.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working with data, you can find me experimenting in the kitchen, always eager to learn new recipes and expand my culinary skills.</p>
            <p>Feel free to connect with me via <a href="mailto:epstain@cooper.edu">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalofek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
